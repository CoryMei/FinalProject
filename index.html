                            <p>‚ÄúThe Social Dilemma‚Äù is a social-media-like informational website. When you scrolling down the website, you will feel like you are exactly scrolling through a common social media website similar to social media apps that you use everyday such as Facebook. This website provides you a relaxing environment to look at and discuss the flip side of coin of social media. After browsing the posts on this website, I believe you will begin thinking critically about implications of social media and rethinking your behaviors and emotions towards it when you scroll with the real social media next time. Don't feel confused, the discussion area under each post is deliberatedly designed to look like someone is talking with itself. Hope you enjoy the website!</p>
