                          A young father is sitting on a sofa surrounded by pamphlets and advertisements for nursery furniture maternity clothing, and pictures of smiling infants, whose recipient is his young daughter. He propped his head with one hand and appears to be confused. He then picks up his phone, makes a dial to the customer service, and asks to figure out why his high-school daughter received those advertisements that are not reasonable for her age. His expression suddenly turns serious, then angry, and he begins to yell at the customer service staff, “How could my daughter be pregnant!” A few days later, he apologizes to the store that her daughter indeed got pregnant without his knowledge. <strong>— A real story from Target in 2012</strong>
                        </p>
                            <p>Do not consider this situation is only imaginary and not relevant to you. It actually adapted from a real event happening on “Target, one of the largest retailers in the United States, creeped people out that the company knew about their pregnancies in advance. In 2012, a precise targeting marketing campaign was addressed to a man’s high-school daughter” and contained advertisements for baby items (Hill). Target has a professional customer data analysis model that can accurately analyze the buying behavior of people at an early stage, and then accurately market products before their competitors do. This news was reported by the New York times, causing a stir across the country at that time. People may find out the fact that with more personal data, human behavior and interactions being analyzed and predicted, they will find that their private life is not private anymore, and their <strong>“secrets” are not secret anymore</strong>. Although companies, such as Target, are “very conservative about compliance with all privacy laws”, they might still make use of big data and do things where people feel uncomfortable and violated (Hill).</p>
                            <p>With the development of modern science and technology and the popularization of digital equipment, the growth of data is explosive in today's society. Massive data is produced regularly through a variety of data sources. The word <strong>“big data”</strong> is increasingly mentioned by the world. People use it to describe extremely large and complex data sets that cannot be captured, managed and processed by traditional data-processing application software, which are usually “analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behavior and interactions”, through the process of data mining. Data mining is “the process of finding and concluding patterns in large data sets, involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems”. The reality of today is that the practice of collecting personal data and using it to shape people's decisions has spread around the world and permeated every aspect of  modern Internet life. Everything we do on the Internet -- every interaction, every purchase, every web search, every location, every thumb up -- is carefully “collected in real time into a trillion-dollar-a-year industry”. According to your spending habits and personal preferences, it can recommend clothes for you on a shopping platform, music for you on a music APP, food for you on a group buying software, and hotel for you on a tourism platform. Take Google Map, the most widely used navigation software, as a specific example. As long as people input the origin and destination, the system will plan out the optimal plan for the route through big data analysis, which saves the travel time and costs results from traffic jams, fuel consumption, and time delay. </p>
                            <p>However, this reality presents an information security gap to us, and this huge gap is the nonstandard network market environment, which raises serious issues. With the help of big data，Companies know users’ personality preferences, assign a large number of data labels to each user, and craft content that belongs only to them.They know what they like, what they fear, what they are interested in, and when they cross the line. Companies know even more than users know about themselves, which is a huge rights asymmetry, as the case of Target shown above. More seriously, people might find their personal information and private life disclosed, and find themselves unconsciously influenced or even controlled by some companies and organizations in various ways. They took your data. Then they took control. </p>
                            <p><strong>Privacy policy is probably the least-read item on most websites and apps</strong>, but it still “remains the most important source of information for users to know how companies collect, use, and share data” (Reidenberg 40). An experiment is conducted to investigate the differences in interpretation and understanding about the practices described in privacy policies among experts, knowledgeable users, and typical users. “For this research, a group of law and public policy graduate students at Fordham University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Pittsburgh ("knowledgeable users") are recruited and presented these law and policy researchers with a set of privacy policies from companies in the e-commerce and news and entertainment industries. They are asked nine basic questions about the policies' statements regarding data collection, data use, and retention. Then the same set of policies is presented to a group of privacy experts and to a group of crowd workers representing typical Internet users” (Reidenberg 40). The discordance among them reflects the fact that “ambiguous wording in typical privacy policies undermines their ability to effectively communicate data practices to the public”, which may mislead the public and may be legally considered unfair and deceptive (Reidenberg 40). This research indicates that users usually do not have clear and right consciousness of how their personal data are actually collected, used, and shared.</p>
                            <p>With the volume of global data growing exponentially every year, more and more “sensitive, protected, or confidential data has potentially been viewed, used or stolen by an individual or organization unauthorized to do so”, which is the so-called <strong>“data breach”</strong>. “According to Statista, which reports on the number of data breaches and records exposed in the United States since 2005, the number of cyber attacks is on an upward trend. In 2005, 157 data breaches were reported in the U.S., with 66.9 million records exposed. In 2014, 783 data breaches were reported, with at least 85.61 million total records exposed, representing an increase of nearly 500 percent from 2005. That number more than doubled in three years to 1,579 reported breaches in 2017 ”(Groot). As a result of increasing personal information disclosure, the method of fraud is gradually upgraded from the netted fraud to the precise fraud. Criminals grasp large sets of data of the victim's family situation, contact information, personal account, phone records and other personal information through a variety of channels, and make up a variety of stories and scenarios to precisely defraud the victim. These stories sound more credible and seem to be more in line with the victim's life. People are thus more gullible. Even worse, many people don't even aware that they have been defrauded.</p>
                            <p><strong>This is the era of big data at its best and worst.</strong> It indeed facilitates people’s life to a certain extent, but some organizations or companies cross the line in gathering and using personal data without users’ authorization. People lack knowledge of what, when, and how their private data are being used. In addition, the era of big data brings about bias reinforcement. On social media, data analysis and prediction models recommend people with similar views to each other, and news feeds are often path-dependent, which means different categories of news are pushed to users based on their historial preference or interests on social media.  As people's sources of information become increasingly dependent on intelligent systems or machines, biases are reinforced by assimilation. Even worse, the targeting tool then becomes a weapon for some organizations and companies to control, influence and change the public. Cambridge Analytica, a big data marketing agency, used Facebook's strong user base and rich social information to analyze and select “The Persuadables” among the Internet users and put them with well-matched political advertisements and information, which intervenes in The 2016 US presidential election and The UK's Brexit. “The data analytics firm that worked with Donald Trump’s election team and the winning Brexit campaign harvested more than 50 millions of individual profiles, in one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches”, and without authorization, used those data to build a powerful algorithm to “analyze, predict and influence choices at the ballot box” by determining personality traits linked to voting behavior (Cadwalladr and Harrison). "<strong>These platforms that were created to connect people, have now been weaponized.</strong> They targeted those whose minds they thought they could change until they saw the world the way they wanted them to.” “ Once people agreed to plug their identities and lives into social networks, they left themselves open to being analyzed, manipulated and propagandized.”</p>
                            <p>Under the era of information bombardment and data explosion, big data poses serious problems that are already happening, or are about to happen, which threaten to shake the foundations of the society. People's personal data are now being viewed, taken, analyzed and utilized for illegal or unethical purposes without their authorization; people’s personal lives and secrets are now being violated; people’s perspectives and decisions are now being manipulated, and even controlled without their knowledge. </p>
