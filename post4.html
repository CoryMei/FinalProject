                          <br>
                          Have you ever compulsively checking Snapchat or mindlessly scrolling through Pinterest...?
                        </p>
                        <p>Although problems brought by social media continue, But things seem to be moving in the right direction, with more and more tech companies being sued over privacy and data issues, and more and more people talking about fear and confusion over social media. But before the problem is completely solved, there are a few things we can do as an individual:</p>
                        <p>1. Silencing notifications and deleting wasteful apps <br>
                          2. Don't passively accept the content recommended to you, but actively acquire it <br>
                          3. Verify the authenticity of any information before sharing it <br>
                          4. The world is very beautiful, go offline to have a look and connect with it <br>
                          5. setting screen time limits</p>
                        <p>We're not able to get away completely from the Internet and be isolated from the fast-changing world. So every Internet users should at least understand how their data is affecting their life. Both the government sectors and businesses should safeguard the users’ position vis-à-vis the bargaining power of the Internet industry and ensure that users are well-informed about the implications of their consent, and any potential alternatives. Internet companies worldwide, especially Internet giants such as Facebook, should and have the ethical responsibility to demand new regulations ( both internal and governmental ) to regulate their behavior and further protect users' privacy.</p>
                        <p>Following data privacy laws could be a good starting point for Facebook and other organizations. Complying with relevant data privacy laws intended to protect consumers, businesses can have more certainty in what they are doing is in line with the ethics of what most consumers would expect. As online data mining tools get more sophisticated, new guidelines and even laws will be formed to protect both customers and businesses.For example, on May 25, 2018, the European Union formally promulgated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Also, some long-existed rules such as The Common Rule should be followed by marketers in organizations when collecting market research data. ( The Common Rule is the baseline standard of ethics by which any government-funded research in the US is held. The main elements of the Common Rule include: Requirements for assuring compliance by research institutions; Requirements for researchers' obtaining and documenting informed consent; Requirements for Institutional Review Board (IRB) membership, function, operations, review of research, and record keeping.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, Companies would be smart to not wait for their industry or the government to establish their policies, and instead do this themselves, which might enable companies such as Facebook to repair its reputation and safeguard customer privacy moving forward. Setting up a Privacy Policy is the first step towards governing ethical data collection in business, but this is just the foundation: Internal privacy practices, ethical expectations for staff, and regular auditing of privacy practices are all crucial to maintaining an ethical data collection regime. “Transparency” Is one of the most important keys to set up a good privacy policy. Most customers accept that their data is collected and analyzed, often for their own benefit — it can help save time and money and lead them to products and services they want., but they just don’t like when this research is done without their knowledge. Some companies do notify customers, but the message often gets lost in fine print or a person’s email inbox. The key is finding a way to be transparent about how the information is used and making sure that the policy is seen by users. As a result, customers should be informed specifically “what their information will be used for, and how and by whom it will be used, how long the organization will keep data, how the customer can access the data, which third parties may also collect user data via your website or service, or who may access data collected by your business, etc.” And the business cannot share the information with other companies, competitors or publicly, unless permission/consent is given by the customer.</p>

                                              I tried to set screen time limit for 3 hrs. Tbh, this indeed takes some effect, but it is always not enough for me...🤫</p>
